| Feature        | Code Runner               | Run C/C++ / Debug C/C++                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Compile & run  | Yes (auto)                | Only if preLaunchTask is set                |
| Debugging      | No (prints only)          | Yes (breakpoints, stepping, variable watch) |
| Output         | Terminal (stdout visible) | Sometimes broken on Windows w/ GCC+GDB      |
| Setup required | Almost none               | Need `tasks.json` + `launch.json`           |


✅ Bottom line

If your goal is just to see output / run code → Code Runner is enough

If your goal is debugging with breakpoints / watch variables → then you need launch.json + tasks.json
